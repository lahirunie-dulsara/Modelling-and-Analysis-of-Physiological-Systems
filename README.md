# Modelling-and-Analysis-of-Physiological-Systems

This repository contains a collection of simulation-based experiments completed as part of a Semester 4 module in Biomedical Engineering. These experiments explore core concepts in physiological systems using computational models and data analysis.

## Contents

### 1. Simulation of Respiratory Mechanics
- Models lung pressure-volume relationships and airflow dynamics.
- Simulates the effect of compliance and resistance on breathing patterns.

### 2. Electrical Properties of Branching Dendrites
- Explores passive signal propagation in dendritic trees.
- Simulates voltage attenuation and spatial/temporal summation in neurons.

### 3. Analysis of Cardiac Physiology
- Analyzes ECG waveforms and heart rate variability.
- Includes simulation of cardiac action potentials and conduction pathways.

### 4. Hodgkin-Huxley Model
- Implements the classic Hodgkin-Huxley model for action potential generation.
- Simulates ionic currents and gating variables in response to stimuli.

## Technologies Used
- Python, MATLAB, or simulation tools (e.g., NEURON, Simulink)
- Jupyter Notebooks or GUIs where applicable

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ``bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/physiological-systems-experiments.git

2. Navigate into each experiment folder for specific instructions and code.

3. Follow the documents in each folder to run simulations and interpret results.
