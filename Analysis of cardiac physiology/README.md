# Respiratory Mechanics Simulation using Simulink GUI

This project uses the MATLAB-based simulator developed by David Leonardo Rodriguez Sarmiento and Daniela Acevedo Guerrero (2020), available on the [MATLAB Central File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/75335-simulation-of-respiratory-mechanics-on-simulink-with-gui), to simulate and compare lung ventilation under three conditions:

1. **Normal Lung Function**  
2. **Restrictive Pulmonary Disease (e.g., Pulmonary Fibrosis)**  
3. **Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (e.g., Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease - COPD)**

## How to Use

1. **Download the Simulator**  
   Clone this repo and also download the Simulink GUI model from [MATLAB File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/75335-simulation-of-respiratory-mechanics-on-simulink-with-gui).

2. **Open in MATLAB**  
   Launch `RespiratoryMechanicsGUI.slx` in MATLAB (ensure Simulink is installed).

3. **Set Parameters for Simulation**
   - Choose `Normal`, `Restrictive`, or `Obstructive` conditions.
   - Modify the lung compliance and resistance parameters accordingly.

4. **Run Simulation**  
   Click on "Start Simulation" in the GUI. Save the output plots for analysis.

## Results & Analysis

The project report includes:
- Alveolar pressure vs. time and lung volume vs. time plots for each condition.
- A comparison of **minute ventilation** (tidal volume Ã— respiratory rate) across conditions.
- Discussion on the physiological differences and ventilator response under constant ventilator settings.
